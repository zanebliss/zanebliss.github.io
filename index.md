# About

My name is Zane. I enjoy Ruby, Rust, Linux, web development, developer tooling, and systems programming.
Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/ZaneBliss).

When I'm not programming, I bike, backpack, and drink coffee. I recommend the [AeroPress Go](https://aeropress.com/products/aeropress-go-travel-coffee-press) with a medium-to-light roast.
